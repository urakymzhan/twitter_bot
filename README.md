# twitter_bot

This is a simple twitter bot 

First create an app on your twitter account: https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps

Then use those tokens and keys on your code.

Also make sure you installed tweepy (pip install tweepy or download from their website)

In the application you can search keywords on twitter and choose to respond to, favorite, retweet the tweet and/or follow the user that tweeted. Along with selecting how many tweets you would like to interact with.

# TODO

Use other tweepy, tkinker API's and modify the code. Example get relationship between two users etc.
